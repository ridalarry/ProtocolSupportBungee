ProtocolSupportBungee
================

Support for 1.6 and 1.5.2 clients on BungeeCord
It might also have 1.4.7 support, but I can't test it minecraft 1.4.7 and 1.5.2 keeps crashing for me

================

This is not a standalone plugin, all server behind BungeeCord should have this installed

================

To make this plugin Work on its best you will need the following:
1. Use the HexaCord version of bungeecord which can be found in the libs files
2. If your server is on online mode and you have errors with failed to login on old clients turn the server to offline mode and use FastLogin plugin from spigot https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastlogin.14153/download?version=115502 This plugin allows cracked players by default, you need to disallow them from the plugin config just like this one https://pastebin.com/mk4Sijdk This plugin need to be installed on both spigot and bungee, for more information about how to install it and so on check this from here https://github.com/games647/FastLogin#how-to-install
