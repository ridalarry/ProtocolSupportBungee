ProtocolSupportBungee
================

Support for 1.6 and 1.5.2 clients on BungeeCord
It might also have 1.4.7 support, but I can't test it minecraft 1.4.7 keeps crashing for me

================

This is not a standalone plugin, all server behind BungeeCord should have this installed

!!! Trying to allow 1.11.2 and 1.12 to work with this plugin

FIRST OF ALL I CAN'T CODE
I am just trying to fix it by testing

To make this plugin Work on its best you will need the following
1. Use the HexaCord version of bungeecord in the libs files
1. If your server is on online mode and you have errors with failed to login on old clients turn the server to offline mode and use FastLogin plugin from spigot (this allows cracked players by default, you need to disallow them from the plugin config)

You can use the premade config for premium server without cracked from here https://pastebin.com/xGUAAjMW
